### YAML - Yet Another Markup Language
1. Yaml works on Indentation. Nothing but spacing. Must have uniform spacing.

Example:
name: Devops
  msg: [Hello, devops, aws]
  name : {
   Company name: [one, two],
   designation: devops engineer
   }
2. Coding patterns
[] - list
{} - map

4. Keys are provided by program(ansible, kubernetes)

6. yaml files contains an extension of yaml, yml.
